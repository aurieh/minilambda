# MiniLambda
A minimal ZSH theme heavily inspired by [lambda-mod](https://github.com/halfo/lambda-mod-zsh-theme) and [dannytatom's lambda](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/blob/f5c45c23ee7958395e80f97228c4267bfd0d4e6c/themes/lambda.zsh-theme).
It only shows information you *really* need. Zero bullshit involved.
